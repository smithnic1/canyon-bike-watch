# Canyon Bike Watch ðŸš²

> **Get an e-mail the moment your chosen Canyon bikes come back in stock.**  
> Runs for free on GitHub Actions every few minutes.

---

## How it works

1. **GitHub Actions** spins up a runner on a cron schedule (default: every 15 min).  
2. A tiny Node script (`watch-canyon.js`)  
   * opens each Canyon product page with Playwright,  
   * checks your size tileâ€™s CSS classes, and  
   * sends one Gmail alert the first time the tile is *not* marked `--unpurchasable / --notifyMe`.  
3. The current in-stock state is stored in `state.json` and committed back to the repo, so you wonâ€™t get repeat e-mails while an item remains available.
